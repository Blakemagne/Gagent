The advanced\_calculator.py file contains several functions for performing advanced calculations:\n\n- add(x, y): Adds two numbers x and y and returns the sum.\n- subtract(x, y): Subtracts two numbers x and y and returns the difference.\n- multiply(x, y): Multiplies two numbers x and y and returns the product.\n- divide(x, y): Divides two numbers x and y and returns the quotient. Returns \"Cannot divide by zero\" if y is 0.\n- exponentiate(x, y): Raises x to the power of y and returns the result.\n- square\_root(x): Returns the square root of x. Returns \"Cannot calculate square root of a negative number\" if x is negative.\n- factorial(x): Returns the factorial of x. Returns \"Cannot calculate factorial of a negative number\" if x is negative. Returns \"Cannot calculate factorial of a non-integer number\" if x is not an integer.\n\nTo use these functions, you need to import the advanced\_calculator module in your Python script:\n\nimport advanced_calculator\n\nThen you can call the functions as follows:\n\nresult = advanced_calculator.add(1, 2)\nprint(result)  # Output: 3
