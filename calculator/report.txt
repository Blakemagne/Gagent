Calculator Codebase Analysis Report

This report summarizes the analysis of the calculator codebase, identifies potential improvements, and presents test results.

1. Code Structure:
The code is reasonably well-structured, with the strategy pattern used in `calculator_refactored.py` providing good extensibility.

2. Error Handling:
`calculator_refactored.py` includes input validation and handles division by zero, which is good. `tests.py` also includes tests for invalid operators and insufficient operands.

3. Testing:
There are existing tests covering basic operations, parentheses, and exponentiation.

4. Inconsistency:
`calculator.py` and `calculator_refactored.py` have different interfaces for the `calculate` method. The former takes an operator symbol (+, -, *, /), while the latter takes operation names (add, subtract, multiply, divide). `main.py` seems to be using a `Calculator` class from the `pkg` directory, which might be different from these two.

Potential Improvements:

1. Consolidate Calculator Logic: Decide on a single, consistent implementation of the `Calculator` class and stick to it. The strategy pattern in `calculator_refactored.py` is a good approach.
2. Standardize Interfaces: Ensure that the `calculate` method (or its equivalent) has a consistent interface across all calculator implementations.
3. Comprehensive Test Suite: Combine the tests from `tests.py` and `test_calculator.py` into a single, comprehensive test suite. Add more test cases, especially for edge cases and error conditions.
4. Clearer Error Messages: Improve error messages to provide more specific information about the error.
5. Support for More Operations: Consider adding support for more mathematical operations, such as modulo, floor division, or trigonometric functions.
6. Input Sanitization: Implement more robust input sanitization to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.

Testing Advanced Features:
The existing `test_calculator.py` already tests parentheses and exponentiation, and the tests passed successfully.
